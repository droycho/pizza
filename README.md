# Pizza Order

#### Webpage designed to demonstrate back-end business logic using Objects, Constructors, and Prototypes, {April 8, 2016}

#### By **DJ Roychoudhury**

## Description

This webpage is not meant to be very exciting, most of the magic is happening in the JavaScript. There are two purposes here: one purpose is to demonstrate understanding of using objects in constructors and prototypes, the other is to separate interface code from business logic code for ease of editing in the future.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* You can go directly to the page link at http://droycho.github.io/pizza/.
*-OR-
* clone repository to your desktop
* once all files are in the proper directory, open the index.html page in web browser and everything should run fine.



## Known Bugs

Unfortunately I did not have time to complete the optional objectives for this project. I got started on adding a button that will allow the user to customize and order additional pizzas, but I was unable to correct the Javascript to make it so that both pizzas will show in the order confirmation field. As it is now, the last pizza created will display as many times as there are pizzas ordered, but will not show the others. Otherwise, the page should function just fine.
